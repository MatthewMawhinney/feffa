Welcome to my personal dump of all things related to web development. I am by no means an expert of the field, my journey only began just over a year ago. With the sheer amount of languages, technologies, and tools to learn, I have only broke the surface of development. I specialize in the front-end, mainly Angular 2+, SASS, HTML5, and everything else that comes with it. I love both spheres of development, on the server I enjoy building apps with Node.js and MongoDB, and I have experience building larger apps with C#, PHP, MSSQL, MySQL, and their related frameworks and libraries.

Most recently I have been dabbling in build tools and task runners like Gulp.js, Webpack, and NPM scripts, expect a blog post about a small project that I am planning for this weekend. I am going to build a boilerplate live server to increase my efficiency building static sites, that I believe will be quite useful for new developers. Thatâ€™s what this blog is going to be all about, I am constantly adding new skills and trying to better older ones, I hope that I can share some projects and information about this process and help those who are at the same stage of their careers as I am, or possibly those who are just starting out as I was a little over a year ago.

Either way, I plan on using my love of writing, coding, problem solving, and design to keep pushing myself and take advantage of this outlet to discuss my experiences (and growing pains) for my own benefit, hopefully yours as well. I hope that you take something positive away from reading my posts and I hope that if you learned something or used some code I wrote, please let me know!
